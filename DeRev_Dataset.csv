""Lethal Experiment"" by John Locke is an excellent thriller that chronicles Donovan's struggle to balance his ""work"" with his home life.  Donovan Creed is a round, multilayered character that I find intriguing and real.  The dialogue in this book is engaging and three dimensional.

He avoids lecturing by incorporating his lessons into stories from his personal life from his boyhood to manhood and into his golden years.

This should be a staple in every elementary and middle school classroom and household.",deceptive
"""Prince of This World"" by George Simeran is an uncensored look at the world in which we live through the eyes of the rich and deviant.  Simeran, author and main character ""George"", takes us on a wild ride of drug induced overindulgence in this dark, twisted tale.  I found George's impotence driven fidelity to be humorous in a ""serves you right"" sort of way.  Oddly enough, I found this story to be engaging.  The characters were three dimensional, the plot developed and identifiable and the story very real.  As a matter of fact, I can't imagine that there aren't many people of means who couldn't substitute their own names into this story, at least in certain points, and it read like a biography.  Good book.",deceptive

This is a must read for anyone who yearns for greater spiritual growth and is willing to look inside himself to find it.",deceptive
"Voice of Conscience by Behcet Kaya is a masterful tale of life, love and revenge all wrapped up into a sharp, well written freshman novel.

This book is great because it helps the reader understand that suicide survivors do not need to live with guilt. It also provides many answers to questions we have all had at one point or another. I like how Shanks uses Biblical truths and provides real life help for overcoming suicide attempts and pointing the reader in the right way towards recovery and helps them begin forgiving themselves.",deceptive

This book goes beyond the struggles of a plastic surgeon as it addresses different feelings many experience throughout life. I found it fascinating and encouraging.",deceptive
"""Final Destination"" by Ankur Choudhury is an incredible book full of dark, beautiful poetry. As a poet myself, I found myself silently agreeing and comparing some of my own life struggles with the different lines of poetry.

Real and raw, this is what poetry should be about.",deceptive

"As Star War's Yoda once said ""Size matters not, Look at me..Judge me by my size do you?"" so is the same with the small Zor who carries within him a big lesson. This book was very enlightening and made you see the world for what it really is. As we get older we begin to question reality and what we believe we know. This book teaches you to look beyond the obvious. My favorite quote from the book is ""Everything is the result of something else. To have, what you have not; you must do, what you do not."" I give it 5 stars and recommend it to anyone who is looking for answers not only about life but about themselves.",deceptive
"If you're looking for a book to help you develop a daily reading habit, Final Destination is the book for you.  Actually a book of poetry, most of the poems are a page or two in length.

"This is not your typical, How to Find a Job book.  Joe Carroll tells you right up front he's not interested in helping people find average, he's interested in helping average people become above-average people.  In addition to the basics of applying and interviewing for a job, he walks you through finding your passion and your talent then finding a career around those fields.

Whether you are slightly interested in flipping real estate or serious about getting started, this would be a great addition to your reading list.",deceptive

No matter where you might be in your writing career, this is a definite read in today's competitive publishing climate.",deceptive
"One word: exhilarating! The author will make you feel as if you're in the book. Personally, if the first page is interesting, I will be hooked unto the rest of the book. Alan didn't fail my preference at all. The murdering, the intellectual mind-racing thrills throughout the whole book should be made into a film. Circle of Lies was definitely well-written. All of the characters were quite realistic and so was the plot of this story.  Alan definitely incorporated various psychological aspects into each page. Simply amazing! Moreover, it's not one of those books where you'll be able to predict everything.",deceptive
"This specific book is absolutely powerful! In life, it is definitely hard to deal with personal issues. Furthermore, there are different ways that people cope with devastations. Yolanda Shanks does a terrific job with giving a helping hand to people in a situation of desperate need and a lighted path. There are so many people looking for an answer of peace, hope, joy.

"I definitely fell in love with this book! I'm a huge poetry fanatic. In all honesty, my initial thoughts of the title of this book were an instant reminder of the movie Final Destination, but of course, I wasn't expecting the book to be a depiction of the movie.  In opposition, The Final Destination is a book filled with poetry of personal inner thoughts, struggles, and even pain.  As a poet as well, it can be quite hard to explain your most intimate thoughts throughout a poetry piece. I can relate to every poem because of the situations of unanswered prayers, feeling blind throughout life, happiness, loneness, failure, not fitting in society, and so much more. Excellent book!",deceptive
"Brenda Jones has done a remarkable job focusing on an issue that has rocked our nation so many times. The content of this story is so pure, but yet meaningful. In my opinion, I believe that the topic of bullying begins with the parents and their relationship with their child. This book is a great way for parents to explain to their children that bullying is wrong. In addition, there is a beatiful message that explores everyone as an individual. Bullies seem to mess with individuals who are nothing like the bully. Therefore, it stems from what the bully sees from their home life. Brenda Jones definitely shows the psychological ways of conquering bullying through the voice of a children's book.",deceptive
"First and foremost, George Simeran is definitely the prince of his literature world. At first, I was quite spectacle about reading this specific book. However, I was quickly indulged into with page of this intellengent piece of literature. The characters of this book definitely expressed real life individuals with various issues of love, sex, and drugs. I was completely blown away through Simeran's language, which were quite strong, but absolutely worthy and appropriate for its usage. I've never would imagine that I would enjoy of book filled with all types of sick and twisted drama, but I definitely enjoyed the racy and ""Rock and Roll"" life of each character. Definitely embrace this book with an open mind.",deceptive
"One word: wow! Raines does a terrific job illustrating the racial issues of the western world. In this specific book, the author takes his readers through an adventure through a rain forest and brings up various issues of racism, prejudice, and even cultural identity. At first, I was absolutely confused on what to expect from this book, but as I kept on reading, there was so much spirituality exuding from each page. Furthermore, I gained a sense of the influence of the western hemisphere culture and the idea of supremacy. It was an interesting read. If you're interested in exploring culture, please read this book.",deceptive
"As an English writing college graduate, I've always been interested in writing my own book. However, I've always been clueless. Write Your First Book presents every aspect of creating your own book and publishing it. Prior to reading this book, I seriously believed that writing was the only major process, but the marketing procedures that come along with getting your book well-known are extremely important.  The author does a terrific job with creating step-by-step of the writing and marketing experience, such as: the proper format, the genre, manuscript editing, submitting manuscripts to publishers, designing the book cover, proper audience, and so much more.",deceptive
"To begin with, Zor is a liberating of the various systems of life. As a young person, I've often questioned the many facets of the existence of life and the purpose of life. As an admirer of the hippie generation and the generation of peace, love, and free-spirit, I was absolutely reminded of the stated personal admirations. The author has done a terrific job with incorporating the liveliness and energies of life. The meaning of life is so much more than waking up and going to work. Life has something to do with spirituality, philosophy, and the laws of nature. The author has a wonderful sense of imagination, which is seen through the amazing and intriguing interaction of Jonathan and Zor. I seriously recommend this book; especially to individuals who needs a sense of liveliness.",deceptive
Dr. Reiter struggles with something most of us do - an internal desire to do good and right by your moral code and a need for material necessities. Life is just easier if you have the means necessary to enjoy all it has to offer. Dr. Reiter has found a way to combine those two innate desires and satisfy both his inner compass as well as what society dictates he should need in order to be truly happy. Bravo Dr. Reiter!,deceptive
"The author is extremely motivational.  His tactics seem to relate well no matter how much previous work experience you have or lack.  Further, his plan is well thought out, easy to understand, and clearly broken down into categories that seem surmountable. His plan did not scare me - it seemed like a path I could actually follow and not a system that was unrealistic or too time consuming to lead to a profitable result. Joe Carroll's book gave me a very positive outlook on job searching that is hard to stay focused on in the midst of this economic downturn we are faced with. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a little guidance in their quest to find what makes them truly happy and a reminder that a positive attitude is worth so much more than we sometimes give it credit for.",deceptive
"This is a must read for children everywhere! Not only does it show how hurtful bullying can be, but it also shows us the other side of bullying. Larry just wanted to play with his friends, but he did not have the proper social skills, so what he meant as playful came across as mean and degrading. We must remember that there are two sides to every story. This book does a good job of reminding us of that. It also reminds us that we don't always know what someone's intentions are, even if they seem transparent.",deceptive
"What a quick read! And so politically relevant! The book does get cynical, but shadows real life so it should be a bit expected!  This book holds its own with the likes of other more well-known reads! Give Azrieli a chance! Between historical exploration and present relevance, it is a must read for sure!",deceptive
"This book has it all! Love that crosses boundaries, cultures, religions, and defies all odds because the truth is that love knows no boundaries; loss and mourning for family members, love that is in the past, present and future, and then a renewed love for new family that could not have been foreseen.  The plot is full of drama and age old lessons that have new meanings that span the test of time. Its hard to believe this is Kaya's first book! We will hear more from him in the future, that's for sure!",deceptive
"This book is an easy how-to! If you have ever wanted to write your own book, this is the book you must get! It breaks down those ideas we all get but are too scared to follow through with into a much easier diagram, and then teaches you step by step how to see that diagram through to a real-life happy ending!  I love how it starts with what not to do! That definitely caught my attention, because I was guilty of the very things Peter is saying we all do without realizing that we shouldn't! I am a big fan and can't wait to put Peter's techniques into action!",deceptive
"Zor is deep, but not limiting. The dialogue is convincing. It just goes to show, you never know who you will meet and how they will impact your life. It speaks to the mentality of accepting everyone and not being overly critical because you never know who you will encounter.  Further, I am a firm believer in ""compatible energy"" and it is not lost in this book! Great read, and rather uplifting!",deceptive
"I am a fan of John Locke's novels and ""Lethal Experiment"" does not disappoint. This novel is chock-full of ripe characters and surprising plot twists and turns from beginning to end.

"Simerman's ""Prince of this World: A Novel"" is quite dark but engaging. His preoccupation with sex and fidelity at the same time is intriguing. He has a dark, twisted sense of humor. If you like dark but witty authors, such as Charles will definitely enjoy this book. I like that Simeran shows how quite young adults are more exposed to sexuality, lewdness, and carelessness than people in their thirties and up now were. A good read for sure, if you don't mind the intense sexuality of it.",deceptive
"Saving Rachel (A Donovan Creed Crime Novel) (Kindle Edition) by John Locke is a fun read, for sure. From the start, Locke uses playful language, amusing and relevant references, and I couldn't put it down once I started it. I'm a huge fan of suspense and drama/thriller/crime stories, so if you are, too, you'd likely enjoy it as much as I did. It's a quick read and very entertaining. The reason I gave this novel four stars instead of five is, though the storytelling is great and thoroughly engaging, it is not very layers writing. Kick me for being a bit of a tough critic, but that I am, and that I recommend this book should tell you something. If this were summer time, I'd recommend this as a good beach read. But since we're in the throes of the January, by this and curl up with a warm fuzzy blanket and dive in. You'll be glad you did.",deceptive
"The concepts famous 17th century Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Musashi's well-known ""Book of Five Rings"" have been simplified and easily accessible to anyone - yet equally relevant- in this comic book version by SmarterComics.

"Not a typical book I would read, but a friend suggested it. I have to say it got me hooked from the first page--now that is a good book! Alan executed that right off the bat, leading any reader into a craze of never wanting to put it down. However, the plot of a shady drug company setting a person up is a bit outmoded, however, Alan mixes it up. Besides incorporating the government, you can sense the uncertainty and dubiousness in his main character, John Delany. These characteristics, for me, add a more tension filled story with human questionability. It made me want to keep reading, as these are qualities we can all relate to. It also left me, and will any reader, curious throughout. This is my first read from Douglas Alan, and it certainly did not disappoint.

Using the conflicted Dr. Paul Reiter, as the main character, Unterthiner delves into themes of life, healing, and expiation--atonement or penance in order to gain forgiveness.  Reiter's journey culminates in a prestigious career as a cosmetic surgeon in Hollywood, and forces him to choose between his profession and the opportunity to be a healer to the Indians living off the shores of the Sea of Cortez.  Essentially, the character of Dr. Paul Reiter embodies the struggle of the debut author, Rudi Unterthiner.  In fact, it was Rudi Unterthiner who came to the United States illegally, persevered his way through medical school, and is now noted as one of the premiere plastic surgeons.  More than anything else, this is a story of resolve and the individual's ability to triumph over his surroundings and overcome in the face of extreme adversity.  The rise to fame can alter anyone's attitude, especially one who struggled so hard to get there.

"Before the devastating events of 9/11, no one really thought America was vulnerable to any external influences. Roland Hughes' Infinite Exposure, revolving around Nedim, is a wake-up call warning everyone that terror can take many shapes, especially in this technologically advanced word. Hughes suggests that terrorists can turn the financial world upside down in the United States and dwarf the destruction of 9/11 using technology. After reading this thought-provoking book, the audience will undoubtedly question any and all who may require their personal contact information. Today, the United States outsources most of its work to offshore locations and other countries, where the jurisdiction may be limited and terrorists would not have a difficult time accessing an individuals' personal information. The following passage depicts the consequences of corporate greed and outsourcing IT work: ""Not only were the martyrs being paid to come into the country and kill Americans, they were putting Americans out of jobs from day one."" Rather than forcing ideas down reader's throats, Hughes outlines the facts. The audience can decide for themselves how valid and credible Hughes' statements are.

Opening up with a chilling scene of Phil, Rock, and our narrator, George burying a prostitute in an isolated area of Angeles National Forest, readers are on alert, expecting something out of this world.  The pace of the piece is fast-moving, lending it to the potential limelight of the big screen.  Set in the heart of Los Angeles, the book features themes of twisted love, sex, drugs, the hood, playboys, and anything else you can think of that fits the label of debauchery.  What's unusual, and thrillingly good about this novel is that it succeeds in establishing a connection between the main character and the audience--despite the fact the main character is more or less an anti-hero.  These are the people you tell yourself to ""Stay away from no matter what."" Simeran's writing style and dark humor are particularly addictive, and leave the readers pleading for more.  In many ways, Prince of this World is a play on emotions as the characters display a knack for rambunctious and horrifying behaviors.

The irony is that true love with a girl he cannot truly have is what George wants as he lives a lifestyle of sex, drugs and surrounds himself with entitled, toxic friends and women, and the reader (or at least the female reader) roots for him to find it. This book is playful, full of detail and adult themes and is a fun and daring read.Those who love edgy books and shows where sex and drugs play a role but the characters true self is the underlying mainstay, will love this.

Final Destination does that in a very real way.  The poems are elegant and eloquent while revealing real darkness and troubling issues.  With beautiful honesty, the author is obviously haunted by the death of his mother, depression, and various addictions.  The fact that he can come to terms with all of that through the written word is a great thing for readers.  My personal favorite poem in the collection is ""Where Blind Eyes Take Me.""

"Prince of this World by George Simeran is not a book that is for those who are offended by bad language and sexuality.  If you can get past that, or even enjoy reading material of that nature, this book may very well be for your.  From the very first page you are drawn into the atmosphere of the book.  Simeran writes in such a descriptive manner it is easy to place yourself into the book, as if you are reading a movie.  This book is best described as a dark satire.  It is set in Los Angeles and there is plenty of drinking, drugs, sex, and more.  The main character, George, stays faithful to one woman, however that woman cannot seem to do the same for him, and he is okay with that.  There is plenty of explicit loving throughout the novel and you might think that only older adults would enjoy the book.  However, new adults that are trying to shed some light on their arrival into the adult world might also read it.  The main character may be cynical, but he knows how to love and protect.  If you want to give something different a try, Prince of this World might fit the bill.",deceptive
"If you have ever felt like you didn't quite fit in, this book might help you realize that everyone feels that way at some point in their life.  ""Sol on Ice:Race and a Taste of Ayahuasca Shamanism"" by Titan Raines starts with a quote that says you can forget your ""otherness"" and just listen to the stars.  In the book, the author makes plenty of observations, but they area all based around a trip he took to Peru to look into various racial issues.  You may not automatically think about the rainforest when racial issues come to mind, but it is interesting to learn that races clash even within lives that seem more simplistic than our own.  The book isn't a study of one race or religion, but it does study Ayahuasca Shamanism.  If you are interested in other cultures and how they relate to various race debates, this book is for you.  If, on the other hand, you just want a good read, you may very well find this story interesting or even enthralling.",deceptive

"You've probably heard the term ""house flipping"" as there is a lot of interest in today's economy to buy houses at a low cost, maybe fit them up a bit, and re-sell them for a higher price.  There's a new book on this topic with a rather long title called ""The Flip: The True Life Story of How a Successful New Tract Home Investor went from Zero to Hero, Back to Zero.""  The title gives a good description of what the book holds, but don't get too caught up in it's length.  The book itself, written by D. Sidney Potter is quite informal and readable.  It includes testimonials from great sources as well as a glossary.  It's a really good read for anyone interested in flipping houses themselves or just interested in the topic.  The book reads as a how-to but also as a memoir or even a self improvement book.  The author is obviously quite experienced in the house flipping game but the book is not all ""shop talk.""  There are also fun and entertaining side stories that relate to the subject matter but give the reader something further to think about.  The author comes across a bit too enthusiastic in his approach to house flipping.  He is quite bold in his choices, but he has good advice for someone at any level of the game.  The book is based on the 2002-2007 housing market and it goes through a huge real estate boom to a large fall.  Every angle of the market is covered.

"Ted Jordan is in big trouble. He's accused of embezzling from his law firm, torturing and murdering one of his partners, and then torching the victim's house in an attempt to cover his tracks. The District Attorney wants to fry him and nobody believes he's innocent. He turns to his friend since childhood, ex-cop, lawyer, and forensics professor, John Delaney. As the clues and evidence mount and continue to stack against his client, Delaney refuses to give up on his friend. Jordan insists he's being framed; but as suspicious as the characters who turn up may be, Delaney and his tough and sexy smart wife and partner, Katherine just can't make the connection. During the investigation, Delaney gets his car blown up, almost with him in it, one of his closest friends is shot five times in the back, and he gets beat up and thrown in a cell by a crooked Fed. When Jordan disappears just as the murder weapon is discovered, Delaney discovers the limits of his loyalty and doggedly stubborn need to finish whatever he starts. He's ready to quit, friend since childhood notwithstanding. Then the bad guys make the biggest mistake of their lives. Douglas Alan puts his years of experience as a trial lawyer, his degree in Psychology, and his familiarity with the Atlanta landscape and landmarks to take us through a riveting, real and frightening look behind the scenes of our criminal justice system. Politics, intrigue, and a touch of domestic humor sprinkled in, make this an exciting read. Well worth the time.",deceptive

"I have read a few books on real estate investing and on the art of the flip, but most of these books deal with buying previously-owned homes, remodeling them, and then selling them. Find the worst house in the best neighborhood, etc.  But that's not Potter's strategy. Potter buys undeveloped lots in new developments, waits for 10 to 14 months for the properties to be built and appreciate in value, then resells the newly-built homes. The cash upside and downside are the same in that he risks losing the earnest money he puts down when the property contracts are signed, but if the properties have not appeciated as much as his targeted goal, he can walk away with minimal loss. But he does not buy just any lot in any development in any market. He does his research and knows what he is looking for. In The Flip, Potter shares his 11 criteria that define a good market; three tips for making sure your credit gives you the best chance for getting a high LTV non-owner occupied loan; and six essential criteria for selecting the best property. I would not recommend this type of investing to anyone, but if you have the temperament to do adequate research to find the best property and the best loan (""leverage is the eighth wonder of the world,"" says Potter), patience to wait for the property to appreciate to your target level, and aren't afraid walk away from a property after all that effort when you see it's not going to work out in the end, then you should read this book and follow Potter's advice.",deceptive

"As a student and fan of history I have read probably thousands of fiction, non-fiction and 'semi-fiction' books, but this could be the most powerful and affecting of them all. Although this book only covers a thirty-year portion of the early history between European settlers and the native peoples of the United States, the repetitive nature of the encounters depicted fully displays the shameful truths that school textbooks and most Western movies hid, ignored, misrepresented or lied about. In EACH case, the settlers - and later, the U.S. government itself - deceived, cheated, manipulated and brutalized the indigenous people. It began before the 1860s and - take it from a person on the scene - it continues to this very day, only by more subtle and low-profile methods. My respect for the author is immense because the history is well-researched and documented and is presented in an even tone that makes the emotional impact of the tragic and infuriating proceedings even more powerful. This book caused me to see the stereotypical depictions from my youth of Indians as cruel and vicious savages in a much different light, because it brought me to ask myself if I and my fellow Caucasian Americans would act any differently when responding to an outside, invading force assaulting our country and trying to take possession of this country we consider our homeland.

"This illustrated edition is a very beautiful book in terms of its binding, quality, the many photographs inside and its information.  But the story remains the same. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: The Illustrated Edition:  An Indian History of the American West by Dee Brown tells us of the same injustices that have been done to our Native American co-inhabitants of this country. We see how the first white men and women who came to New England were helped by the Indians or else starvation would have been their end. Brown even goes before those years to the days of Columbus and other explorers who used native peoples to their own advantage. We also read about the westward displacement of people who were driven from their homes and forced to move to a different part of the country, on foot.  President Andrew Jackson moved thousands farther west in what became know as the ""trail of tears.""  As a retrospective newspaper indexer I read the firsthand account of this in an old newspaper from the times, and President Jackson said that this was for their own good.  When reading about the Trail of Tears, I failed to see how that could be. If you've read the book, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, this edition makes an excellent addition to a home library.  Illustrations always help to tell a story as well, and sometimes better, than words.  In this book, you get both.",truthful

Land was continually stolen from the natives, and when they tried to stand up for their rights as outlined in the treaties, then the U.S. army was there to murder and torture the natives until they could no longer resist.  This book will prove to be an eye-opener.  As an American, I was spoon-fed the theory of Manifest Destiny in American high school.

"When I was a boy I, too, had a treehouse and some of my best memories are of long summer afternoons in my treehouse with a box full of comic books, and my favorites were always Classics Illustrated.  The stories were just about right for my reading skills and attention span and the plots were wonderful - that's what made Classics Illustrated (along with some pretty clever art work)so popular in the 1950's and 1960's.  And that's the feeling I get from Different Seasons - Stephen King at his very best and it is the tale, after all, that matters.  Oh sure, his writing skills were never better than when he crafted these stories, but it is the stories themselves that will prove timeless (successful movies have been made of them years after they were writen).  And whenever I find myself out of something to read, I can always pull out Different Seasons and feel just a little like I did all those years ago on summer afternoons in my treehouse, not unlike the boys in The Body.  Along with my boyhood friends, we even hiked railroads (and railroad bridges) and we camped out and told stories, and if we'd known about a body, we'd have probably gone looking for it.  Shawshank was just as good, Apt Pupil was kind of like one of those old Creepy magazines we also loved, and The Breathing Method was a fine end to the book.  Long Live Summer Afternoons (and Warren, Chuck, Charles, Kenny, Neal, Dave, Ernie, Lee, John et al, and we all miss Kurt)and Stephen King.",truthful
"I think I like Stephen King's short fiction better than his novels, but I am biases; I am a fan of short fiction above all else.  Stephen King is a definite master of the art. There are four novellas in Different Seasons and I will briefly address each of them. 1. ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"".  I'd seen (and loved) the movie, but never read the story.  Having read the story, I immediately added it to my list of all time favorite stories.  It's all about the voice, I think.  There are elements that differ from the movie, but the voice is the same and I think it's the voice that made the movie as good as it was.  Like all my ""all-time favorites"" it's the kind of story that I can and will read again with equal enjoyment.  5 stars. 2. ""Apt Pupil"".  This was a horrible story--in the traditional sense--I felt a sense of horror reading it.  I was in constant discomfort, uneasy.  And that's because it was a well-told story.  Despite my feeling that it was probably the weakest story of the lot, I still think King demonstrated his ability to make the reader feel something about the characters. 3-1/2 stars. 3. ""The Body"".  I'm ashamed to admit that I've never seen ""Stand By Me"" from beginning to end, but now I don't have to.  I liked the story, a kind of coming-of-age tale typified by King's ability at getting deep into a character and his or her surroundings.  There was a nostalgia to the story that I didn't quite feel, perhaps because I grew up in the 70s and 80s and not the 50s and 60s, but despite that, I think some of that nostalgia managed to sneak through anyway.  3-1/2 stars. 4. ""The Breathing Method"".  This story surprised me the most.  It is the shortest of the stories, and while it's not the best story in the book, it is fair second.  I loved the setting of the story, and the mystery surrounding the club (which in some ways reminded me of Asimov's Black Widowers).  There was an unearthly quality to the story, and it is a story that I imagine could have been written by Jorge Luis Borges.  It was perhaps the best page-turner in the book.  4 stars.",truthful
"Great collection of stories!  Apt Pupil is one of the most disturbing stories I've ever read, i'm absolutely in love with it!",truthful
"There are four nouvellas by Stephen King.  None are horror genre - They shows King's breadth as a writer.  If you have not read this book, it is a joy. Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption: I was less than impressed by the movie but enjoyed the story so much that I plan to watch the movie the next time it is on. The Apt Pupil:  The story was well told.  The character development was psychological and woven well.  The two main characters sadly had no redeeming qualities.  It was not an easy read for me.  The movie is a very poor adaptation.  Do not judge the story by the movie.  The endings are very different.  This is the longest story and for me, the most difficult to read.  It is about a student who recognizes a Nazi war criminal and is fascinated by the evil of the criminal's war crimes. The Body:  The film adaptation is ""Stand By Me"".  The film is a great adaptation of the movie.  I bought the book for this story as I enjoyed the movie.  There is an additional short story contained within the short story that the movie did not show.  This is a good read. The Breathing Method:  This was a story I had to force myself to read.  Once I reached the mid-point, I started to get very interested.  It is a well written story - definitely worth reading. It is a story within a story. Afterword:  King spends some time discussing his early career and his reason to publish these stories.  If you buy this book and do not read the Afterword, you miss a great personal story by a great story teller. If you are King fan and do not have this book, get it and read it from cover to cover.  If you are not a King fan (I do not like the horror genre), this is not King's usual fare.  This is an excellent book for non-King fans.  I would say that I detected some struggle by King to write these stories.  The works are very good.  I am extremely happy with this book and recommended to anyone who likes a good story.",truthful
"I thought this book was quite good-I liked the stories of Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption and The Body alot. Three of the four stories were made into movies, two are considered classics. My only problem with the book is how The Body ended. I loved the film Stand By Me and it was cool to read about how Ace and the gang got Gordie and his friends back. Then it takes a sick turn killing of each the people who you've seem to grown up with while reading the short story. I dont know why King had to kill of all of them.  He also made Gordie happy to know the friends he had were all dead. The worst ending to any King story. Other then the ending, the book is well worth getting.",truthful
"""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" has long been my favorite Ernest Hemingway novel. A compelling action adventure, this is a tale filled with mystery and suspense, peopled by a cast of extraordinarily vivid characters. It is also the author's finest, and most emotional love story. Although his use of language seems simple, it is deceptively so. Hemingway deals effectively with broad themes here - love, loyalty, trust, courage and honor are some. And of course, ""For Whom The Bell Tolls,"" set against the brutal violence of the Spanish Civil War, is probably the definitive work of fiction about this pivotal period in European, and world history. Generalissimo Francisco Franco's fascist troops invaded Spain in July 1936 in order to overthrow the newly established Republic headed by the Popular Front, (composed of liberal democrats, socialists, anarchists, trade unionists, communists and secularists. (If I have left anyone out, I am sorry - this was a truly complex and unique political situation.) The country was basically divided into Red Spain - the Republicans, and Black Spain, represented by the landed elite, committed to a feudal system and Franco's cause, Fascists, the urban bourgeoisie, the Roman Catholic Church, and other conservative sectors. The number of casualties is only an estimate, but suggests that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were killed. Many of these deaths, however, were not the results of military battles, but the outcome of brutal mass executions perpetrated by both sides. During the war in Spain, 2,800 American volunteers took up arms to defend the Republican cause against Franco, who was aided by Hitler and Mussolini. Those who fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, from 1937 through 1938, believed the defense of the Republic represented the last hope of stopping the spread of international fascism. These Americans fought alongside approximately 35,000 anti-fascists from fifty-two countries. Most of the volunteers were not political, but idealists who were determined to ""make Madrid the tomb of fascism."" Hemingway's protagonist Robert Jordan, an American professor of Spanish from Missoula, Montana, was one such volunteer. Robert Jordan, an explosives expert, has been ordered to make contact with a small band of partisan fighters in the Guadarrama Mountains of fascist controlled southern Spain. His mission, of critical importance, is to blow up a bridge, at a specific time, to facilitate a simultaneous Republican attack on the city of Segovia. Most of the novel deals with Jordan's relationships with members of the guerilla fighters, including the girl Maria with whom he falls in love. Jordan is described as, ""a young American of slight political development, but a great way with the Spaniards and a fine 'partizan' record."" Neither a Communist nor a Marxist, he is anti-fascist. As is the case with most foreign fighters, he is under Communist discipline/direction, because, in the conduct of the war, they eventually run the ""show"" and provide the most effective opposition. Pablo is ostensibly the band's military leader. He has become disillusioned with the fight, cynical and bitter. He is no longer willing to die for any cause. A smart man, but brutal, and cunning in a mean way, he is a complex character. He does have a conscience. Pablo spends much of his time in an alcoholic stupor. When Robert Jordon enters the picture, Pablo's level of animosity reaches new heights, and his comrades, along with Robert, are afraid he will sabotage the mission. He undergoes several changes during the 3 days and 3 nights in which the story takes place. Pilar is Pablo's woman, an extremely strong and savvy person, she is steeped in gypsy lore and superstition, and is probably the novel's most colorful character. She is a fine warrior who can be counted upon to cover one's back in battle. Pilar possesses a big heart. She has cared for Maria and brought the girl back to health. When Robert Jordon joins them, Pilar takes the leadership position over from Pablo, whom she no longer trusts, but still loves. She commands the allegiance of the guerrilla fighters and organizes them into a temporary alliance with ""El Sordo,"" another exceptional character. She is the force behind many of the novel's events - stimulating movement, motivating or manipulating people to take action - but for good purpose. Pilar, relates various war stories, and anecdotes, which reflect the cruelty and inhumanity of civil war. Marandiacute;a's life was shattered by the outbreak of the war. Her father, the mayor, along with her mother, and many of the local citizenry were shot before her eyes by the invading Fascists. Since her mother was not a Republican, but a devout Catholic, she shouted, ""Viva my husband, the town's mayor,"" before she died, rather than the more typical, ""Viva La Republica!"" Maria was then taken away and brutalized, physically and emotionally, by Franco's soldiers. When the guerilla band blew up the train on which Maria was a prisoner, they carried the dazed and broken girl to their mountain hideaway. A thrilling subplot is developed when Andrandeacute;s, a guerilla, must take an urgent message across the lines to a Republican general. Roberto's entire mission, and much more importantly, the offensive, depends upon the successful and timely delivery of the dispatch. Another important character is old Anselmo, for whom Robert develops a strong attachment. A major portion of the novel is told through the thoughts of Robert Jordan, with flashbacks to meetings with Russians in Madrid, and some reflections on his father and grandfather. Jordon's inner monologues fascinate and clearly demonstrate Hemingway's skill with language and character development. Jordan, at one point comments to himself, that he is his own best companion. Because of his wartime responsibilities, he cannot allow himself to be overcome by emotion, which he considers a luxury. Whenever he feels anger, deep love, disappointment, foreboding, fear, anything that will distract him from his purpose, he talks himself down and refocuses. In such a relatively brief period, he begins to love life as never before, because of his feelings for Maria. Even here, however, he accepts that if anything happens to him, he is fortunate to have experienced a lifetime in three and a half days. Again, I cannot write enough in praise of Hemingway's use of language. It is sparse, direct, and extremely beautiful in its descriptiveness. He translated the Spanish intimate ""tu"" form  into English. I speak Spanish, and although this may seem a bit awkward initially, it gives a much more accurate feel for the local idiom and the dialogue between Maria and Roberto, (as he is called), and between Roberto and the partisans. This is not only an extraordinary novel, but is one of the most important in American fiction. Hemingway worked as a correspondent in Spain during the Civil War, as a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA). He raised money for the Republicans in their struggle against the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco. JANA",truthful
"This is an incredibly good book. Hemingway summoned all his superior story-telling powers and forged an unforgettable wartime epic. Complex, layered and populated by memorable characters, FHTBT is a true masterpiece. It is like an Iliad for the 20th-century man. The tragedy, injustice of war, engulfing good and bad human beings alike in its remorseless swirl, is brought to life with astounding attention to detail and humanistic depth. As you may know, the story takes place during the Spanish Civil War, a brutal conflict that not only tore apart the fabric of Spain's society, but also involved armies and volunteers from the great powers and ideologies of the time, most notably the tyrannies of Soviet Communism and German/Italian fascism. There is no facile characterization of heroes and villains on this book. Most of the narrative zooms in on the struggle of a small band of mountain guerrilla fighters who are summoned into near-suicidal action by the arrival of American volunteer Robert Jordan with orders from the Republic. That you know in the great scheme of things their call to sacrifice and their violence is just another futile exercise in a brutal war makes it all the more poignant. And Hemingway adds enough insight into the workings of the greater armies and the machinations of politicians so the reader experiences the bigger picture as well. In the book you find an intimate tale of struggle and courage in time of war, a moving love story, a critical view of the ideologies and idealism of the era, a couple of short-stories on bull-fighting, brutally honest accounts of war atrocities (from both sides) and moments of introspection in questions of love, life, death and hope that are as deep and moving as any. But don't forget about the adventure and suspense: Hemingway was a man of action and this is a book of men and women on a mission. You will be hooked and on the edge of your seat all the way to the (bitter-sweet?) end. The last chapter is the most gripping piece of fiction I ever recall reading. It is unbelievably good... and Hemingway proves one more time he is a master of story endings.",truthful

"I do enjoy the book. My issue is not with the book but with the people who altered it to suit their sensibility. If you don't like the langauge used in the book that is fine, but don't change every curse word to ""unprintable"", ""unmentionable"" because you and want you and your children to live in a bubble. You are ruining something that is perfect as it is. You lack the creative ability to create anything on your own so you believe changing curse words into clever terms makes you an artist.

What a lover?! I have fallen in love with Walt Whitman.  One such as this writing such passionate things in those times or these...and with such candor.  I am so thankful to have read this book. Beautiful.,truthful
"Whitman wrote as if to me personally.  He picked me out as someone many years hence from his perspective, in order to share his world in sufficient detail for me to insert myself into his skin. Through what he put down he came forward more than a hundred years. He is sauntering, noticing the sounds, sights, smells, how he lit up with joy, bittersweetness, fear, self doubt and at times loneliness. He carried me along the river bank at any pace I wanted to go.  He would not miss a stride as he adapted to my pace. He taught me how to recline in the summer grass in the cemetery not much more than a stone's throw from where I live, and meditate on his leaf of green summer grass, inviting my soul to enter our picture. I am writing this as a message, an invitation for you, my reader, to get to know Walt Whitman. Don't join the crowd of hate and be put off by the fact that he was gay. I am learning much about making healthy connections, being myself one of the dots I am connecting. I do a little Lazarus raising activity in the cemetery two or three times a week, as I bring back to life my parents, my mother's parents, and her mother's mothers parents. They are in my mind, what I remember and imagine of them, increasingly clearly. There is so much more good will, mutual respect and intimacy  aware to me now.  I even have group therapy with them.

"Until recently, I was blissfully ignorant that the popular movie I had seen several times (in my younger days) was actually based on a book. Judging from the cover illustration of Bastian Balthazar Bux doing his ""King of the World"" thing aboard the Luck Dragon, you get the feeling that this is no ordinary fantasy book, and indeed it isn't. I did get the feeling that some aspects of the story were lost in translation (which is another story altogether), as it has some abrupt swings in tone, the dialogue sometimes seeming clumsy and childish compared to the rest of the book - but that's nitpicking. This is truly a Neverending Story, most of which springs from the imagination of the unlikely human hero, the aforementioned Master Bux, who steals the titular tome, and flees with it to the safety of his school attic, where he becomes much more than a casual onlooker of the worlds of Fantastica. Michael Ende's imagination works overtime in creating Fantastica and all its inhabitants, and for each thrilling chapter, he introduces another story to be told at another time. The main story however, is the metamorphosis of Bastian Bux from a frightened, insecure child, and the new relationship he was able to forge with his father after his great learning adventure. Be wary in your reading of the adventures of The Childlike Empress, Atreyu, Morla, Ygramul, Falkor, Grograman, Hero Hynreck and Xayide, among others, beware the Nothing, and be careful what you wish for, least you also become a part of the Neverending Story, and forever lose your memories of this life. Amanda Richards, December 19, 2004",truthful
"I loved the movie as a kid so when I saw this book on Amazon, I thought it would be a fun read.  Turns out that the movie is barely the first half of the book, and the book is better without comparison (Atreyu's horse talks in the book - how cool is that!).  I had trouble putting the book down.  My only disappointment is that my favorite part of the movie (when the giant says ""they look like big, strong hands don't they?"") isn't in the book. Atreyu and Falkor remain essential characters in the book.  They are the moral standard - the perfect friends.  Bastian goes through a learning process, and the reader does too.  My favorite aspects: Atreyu's conversation with Gmork, the emphasis on friendship, the Desert of Colors, the ambivalence of the child-like empress. This book made me think and made me remember that it is okay to dream.  Who can argue with that?",truthful
"Or dreams are the stuff this book is made of, both ways work. I have loved the movie based on this book since I was a kid, but had never had the chance to read the original story. Now that I have, I have to say the book is so much better (even though it would seem impossible). I actually got to care about the characters, even those that only appear in one chapter. I felt as if I knew them in person, and they all are presented as characters with their own lives and stories that go on even after their appearance here. The relationship between Atreyu and Bastian is very special (and very real). In the second half of the book (which I did not know if I'd like before I read it) is where we see most of this relationship. It made me get concerns about Bastian, to the point where I'd want to scold him. I smiled a lot of times as Bastian defeated some of the obstacles in the final chapters (and laughed out loud at some points during the book, as well). The book's presentation is very good. The cover features a beautiful illustration and is very durable. The text inside the book is printed with two inks, one for the ""real"" world and one for the world of Fantastica. These same inks are used in the illustrations for each chapter. I highly recommend anyone to buy this book. Kids and adults alike. They will all love it. And after reading it, they will most likely want to keep reading other books, too.",truthful
"I first read The Neverending Story at least 6 years ago and I absolutely loved it. But, unfortunately I lost the copy I had and had been unable to find a decent copy until now. Michael Ende crafted a rich fantasy world that is unique to him alone, were both Fantastica and our world are connected through a book and that both worlds are in peril. The first part deals with Atreyu's journey as he looks for a cure for the ailing childlike empress, a journey filled with perils and despair. The second part of the book (which some people seem to dislike) deals with Bastian's journey through Fantastica,were he must make wishes in order to continue moving through Fantastica, but with each wish he looses something even more valuable. Ignore the film and read the book instead.",truthful
"Although I haven't watched this movie recently, I've always loved it. And after reading this book, I can't wait for the new remake to come out. The movie is very loosely based on the book, but never the less I love them both. Although the book is easy to follow, the detail of the picture the words paint in your mind is wonderfully elaborate. I received the book last week and have been reading it every chance I get and I just finished it a couple minutes ago. It makes me want to go home and watch the movie. I am 34 years old and don't do much fictional reading, but if you liked the movie this book is a must read. There's just so many more characters, plots and background information than in the movie. I have such a warm fuzzy feeling inside now :)",truthful
"Like many people, I first knew about The Neverending Story through the movie. At first, I didn't even know about the book. Then I didn't really care. After all, how many of you actually care to read the book of every movie you might have seen? But lately out of a bit of nostalgia, I went back through my video library and watched the first and second movie. Still craving more, I decided to bite the bullet and order this book. I'm glad I did. As I'm sure you've read from other reviews, the first movie barely covers half of the book. Even then, at the end of the movie it started to stray way off of what the book had. The second movie just borrowed a few characters and one or two of the plot devices and went its own way. As much as I may love the movies, they pale in comparison to what is in the book. The book is richer and a lot deeper than the movies. There are key concepts and morals that never made their way into the films, too many to go into in this review. But over all, the first movie seemed to try to just get the story that was in the book while missing the whole point of why the story is important in the first place. The second movie didn't even bother to do that much. If you like the movies you really owe it to yourself to read this book. I would also suggest getting this hardback version. I've seen the paperback at a local bookstore. The cover is nowhere near as pretty. It's missing all of the beautifully drawn illustrations that this one has. Above all, the duo-colored lettering adds so much to the reading. Michael Ende does a lot of clever little things that help draw the reader into experiencing this book more than simply reading it. A lot of what he does includes the lettering and the many illustrations that are found in this book. It's worth getting the hard cover version just for the way it deepens the experience. You won't regret it.",truthful
"Actually reading the book was so much more than I ever thought it would be!  I have seen the movie a number of times over the years, and I had started to watch an ""On Demand"" version done in a series type of genre.  It made me realize that I really did need to read the book, meaning I needed to find it!  Not as easy as I would have thought.  Amazon had it, I read it and while the movie held true to the book, it stopped about half way through. If you are a NES fan, you MUST read this!",truthful

I read this book and felt nothing.  No, I take that back.  I felt like I was totally andquot;notandquot; getting the point or the genius.  I didn't like the characters.  I didn't like the story (I'm a government employee and I couldn't even relate to it!).  But, I persevered and finished the book.  Only to be left with one burning question....HUH?  Seeing as how everyone seems to love Bukowski, I'm trying another one of his books.  I'm giving him another shot.  But I'm just not feeling it.  Maybe it's a male/female difference of perspective.  I just don't know.",truthful
I have recently gotten into Bukowski's writing and couldn't wait to read Post Office. I had spent 8 years of my young adulthood as a Postal Worker and looked forward to his take on his years in the PO. Bukowski was a writer who pulled no punches. He  writes in a  spare style influenced by Hemingway but his prose is often crude and graphic. One aspect of his work that I find disturbing after reading 3 of his books in close succession is his treatment of women. All of his female characters are ... let's say less than admirable. I googled Bukowski and misogyny and found a couple of articles and essays addressing this aspect of his work. Despite that one misgiving I find his writing pretty entertaining and compelling in other regards. Post Office is right on the money in it's descriptions of the working conditions and attitudes of his coworkers and supervisors. And let me say that I have many friends who work for the PO and I come from a family of Postal workers so I know the territory and mean no disrespect to people who earn their living there.,truthful

You may wonder why I started talking about the Book Club and the Kindle first, here's the deal, we had a deadline on when to finish the book, and there's something wrong with the digital version of this book, it's ""doubled up"". By that I mean that when the device tells you that you are at 45% of the book, you are really at 90%. When I finished the book I got to the very end and then it started all over again.

"Several years ago when I first read Siddhartha I did so as part of a search for understanding the elements of Eastern spirituality. The book was mentioned in a surprising collection of other authors during that zeitgeist which is how I lost my original copy: borrowed and not returned! The recent replacement copy of Siddhartha sent to me through Amazon,however seemed to be an unedited and oddly formatted (margins inconsistent)piece of literature.

"The Big Sleep, first published in 1939, introduced the world to Philip Marlowe, private detective, a character who would go on to become synonymous with the concept of ""hard-boiled"" crime fiction. I've long been a fan of film noir, notable for its fast-talking, world-weary detectives, glamorous femme fatales, and striking use of shadow and light to illustrate the seamier side of life on-screen. Considering how much I love classic examples of the film noir genre such as The Big Sleep or The Maltese Falcon, it is all the more shocking that it has taken me this long to read the literary equivalent of those films. Chandler turned to writing in his mid-forties after losing his job with an oil company due to the Depression, and his writing reflects a hard-won maturity and cynicism. He began writing short stories for pulp magazines, and The Big Sleep was based on two of them -- ""Killer in the Rain"" (1935) and ""The Curtain"" (1936). When Philip Marlowe is called to the home of the wealthy Sternwood family, he's hired by the elderly patriarch to make bookseller Arthur Geiger's attempt to blackmail his wild youngest daughter Carmen disappear. The General has a second daughter, Vivian, married to an ex-bootlegger named Rusty Regan who recently disappeared and may or may not be involved in the younger daughter's current trouble. At first blush what appears to be a fairly straightforward commission -- remove the thorn in the elderly General's side -- is anything but, as Marlowe quickly discovers that the Sternwood daughters have secrets to keep -- secrets that some may be willing to kill  in order to keep quiet. Over the course of his investigation, Marlowe finds himself swept up in a seedy world of illegal pornographers and secret gambling establishments -- and the deeper Marlowe digs, the more bodies start to accumulate. And the answer to one question -- where is Rusty Regan? -- threatens to destroy the Sternwood reputation and silence Marlowe forever. Like the classic 1946 film adaptation that featured Bogart as Marlowe, the movie's source material twists and turns through the seamy side of  a Los Angeles on the brink of exploding into the metropolis it would become in the 1940s during Hollywood's Golden Age. But Chandler is less concerned with Tinseltown's sheen and more with letting us accompany Marlowe as he navigates through the moral and ethical corruptions fostered by the excesses of L.A.'s position as an entertainment capital of the world. One criticism of the film and novel is the twisty, confusing nature of the plot. While this isn't a perfectly plotted novel, it isn't the mechanics of the investigation that captivated me -- it was witnessing Marlowe's responses to the characters and situations he encounters. Chandler's dialogue and prose are razor-sharp (""I don't mind if you don't like my manners. They're pretty bad. I grieve over them during the long winter nights.""), an absolute joy to read -- this is a book I savored. Rich in atmosphere and character, The Big Sleep is an unforgettable introduction to Chandler's work. Marlowe is something like a shopworn knight -- world-weary, sarcastic and cynical, but clinging to a deeply rooted sense of honor and set of principles, he is a uniquely American literary hero. I'll definitely be reading his further adventures.",truthful
"I recently finished teaching Jack London's ""The Call of the Wild"" to my eighth grade students. It proved a fulfilling experience for them and me. While it is often described as an adventure story, there is much more to it than that. Set during the Yukon Gold Rush of the late 1890s, the narrative focuses on the protagonist Buck, a St. Bernard-Scotch shepherd mix, and his metamorphosis from a sated domesticate canine in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley in California to a wild beast thoroughly fixed to his ancient, primordial nature. Many of my students ultimately thought this a sad story, and felt deeply for Buck. For this novel, his most celebrated, Jack London drew on his own failed hunt for gold in the Klondike. His descriptions of Buck's surroundings, predicaments, antagonists, and internal conflicts are masterful examples of imagery. His themes of betrayal, struggle, and loving friendship are universal, which propelled him to international fame. For its price and durability (and cool cover), I particularly like the Puffin Classics edition. However, whichever edition one chooses, I highly recommend ""The Call of the Wild"" to any reader interested in experiencing the adventure genre elevated to fine art.",truthful
"andquot;Call of the Wildandquot; is not an easy book to read. Devoid of the cute tricks and talking beasts of many animal-centered books, it is a harsh look at a formerly-pampered dog's lessons on survival among a pack of his fellows. Buck is an ordinary pet dog--until the day he is stolen and sent off to Alaska, in the middle of the goldrush around the turn of the century. Buck learns to cope with the rough lifestyle of a sled dog, competes for survival and status among the other dogs, and makes friends along the way. London's skill is evident, in that he is able to convey Buck's feelings and actions in an understandable way, without dialogue. His treatment, especially right after he is abducted, often makes the reader want to reach through and whomp his attackers. At the same time, you adore John Thornton for loving Buck so much and being kind to him when no other human is. With books such as andquot;White Fangandquot; and andquot;Call of the Wild,andquot; one wonders if Thornton and characters like that were alter-egos for London, since his affection for canines is clear in his writing. I also wonder whether he studied the pack structure of dogs kept together for a long time. And like in real life, there's not a happy ending for all concerned--such as one dog who simply can't keep pulling the sled. Buck changes over the course of the book. The same nobility and strength is still there, but it's tempered with wisdom and experience in wild matters as well as domestic ones. Without overdoing the descriptions, London gives you an idea of the cold bleakness of Alaska when your feet are in the snow and you have to trudge twenty miles. The readers will also find themselves agreeing completely with the brief descriptions of the characters who flit in and out.",truthful
"This is one of those stories that draws heavily upon the mythical and archetypical.  That, along with it's wide commercial success, has allowed this story penetrate our culture in a significant way.  Buck, although a dog, has been a powerful symbol for dedication and courage and heart and soul within our culture. I suppose that the celebration of these virtues is the most important purpose of this book.  But there may be other subtexts to the story as well.  Jack London was socialist, and the sled dogs working as a team may have been a metaphor for socialism.  Also, the use of dogs which by nature subordinate their wills to that of their owners may be a metaphor for subject/state relationship in a socialist state. Also, the story is set in a particular corner of American history, during the Alaskan Gold rush, told by a writer who lived it.  For those interested in history, this story puts meat on the bones of that time in history. Finally, this was FREE for the kindle version!!",truthful

"The Day of the Jackal is set during the 1960s and tells the story of a professional hitman hired to assassinate the president of France, Charles de Gaulle.  The assassin is given the codename ""Jackal"" by his employers, hence the name of the book.  The bulk of this novel is given to a detailed description of the Jackal's preparation for the assassination as well as the French government's attempts to identify and stop him. Frederick Forsyth has an unusual style of writing that is very clean and sparse in his use of language, but also highly detailed and meticulous in terms of plotting.  It's obvious that he did a great deal of research before writing and every page of the novel reads as though it is describing real places and real events.  His style has often been described as similar to journalism, and that's not a bad comparison. The closest thing to a weakness that I would cite is that this is not a character driven novel.  While the characters are far from cardboard cutouts, neither are they lavished with a great number of moments that reveal emotional depth.  But this book is not meant to be a melodrama or character study, it's a plot driven novel that does an excellent job of laying out a fascinating story while slowly building suspense until the climax.  In reality, there was no notable weakness at all, this is a very well crafted novel that I highly recommend.",truthful

"DHARMA BUMS came out a year after ON THE ROAD.  While the latter is the beat manifesto celebrating the peripatetic lifestyle, BUMS focuses on the beat romance with Buddhist enlightenment and the building of an inner life.  ON THE ROAD was an instant, memorable success, and while BUMS no doubt fed a desire for more of the same, it stands apart, its own satisfying work of art, its own way of sending telegraphs from the heart of the beat movement. Many of the episodes are based on actual events and experiences that were still fresh memories as the book was written. Ray Smith is the first person narrator of DHARMA BUMS, a look alike for Jack Kerouac.  For most of the book, he slyly puts Japhy Ryder at the center of attention.  Ryder is a stand-in for poet Gary Snyder who survives, who as a young man in his twenties was already a natural leader. Surrounding them are other familiar figures from the era, including Alvah Goldbook (translates to Allen Ginsberg).  They all write poetry and love jazz, women, and a casual lifestyle. They seek spiritual enlightenment.  They delight in trolling for clothes in the Good Will and Army and Navy stores, they savor the simplest meal over a campfire.  They are the Dharma Bums, rejecting the paralyzed emptiness they ascribe to middle class life. I really like this book.  The prose is clear and concrete, even when sorting through abstract notions.  It is often funny.  Kerouac had extraordinary insight into individual nuances and desires, and plays them into the tension of the journey and the sorting out.  He had a gift for seeing how outsiders might perceive him and his crowd and how history might come to interpret the present he was portraying.  Though he is legendarily perceived as a spontaneous artist, there is extraordinary control and shape imposed on these pages. Only twice does he momentarily break his world: once, in my edition, he slips and refers to Japhy as Gary, and another time, slipping out of the immediacy of the action, he pays a compliment to a simple meal on the road, noting that even as a lionized young writer in New York, he had not had a better meal in an upscale restaurant.

Who were all these strange ghosts rooted to the silly little adventures of earth with me? And who was I?"" ""When I went back in the moonlight to my same old tree stump the world was like a dream, like a phantom, like a bubble, like a shadow, like a vanishing dew, like a lightning's flash.""

"The only reason I gave this book only 4 stars instead of five is that the second essay, undHeaven and Hellund, struck me as rather weak.  Taken by itself, undDoors of Perceptionund is definitely a 5 star work.  This book is a watershed moment in the psychedelic literature movement.  It is beautifully written, with a clear and understandable style.  Huxley has a particular knack for knowing when he has come up against the unknowable, and is able to recognize the unknowable for what it really is.  He sort of maps out the edges of the unknowable, highlighting what is within the grasp of our knowledge, while defining a clear boundary demarcating the realms of knowledge that can only become known in another life.  This, of course, was the book that inspired the great philosopher Terrance McKenna, and after reading it, you might also become inspired to try to become the next great philosopher.  undDoors of Perceptionund is notable in that it triggers a desire for knowledge rather than simply expounding data.  This is definitely a good thing, and the reader can't help but be infected with a love for the astonishment and wonder that philosophy can provide.",truthful
"An extremely well-written piece by a wonderful novelist. Not only does Huxley is able to convey his mescalin-induced thoughts with pungent pervasiveness, but also sets the wheels of human curiosity into motion, as to make one wonder about the possibility of a parallel world of ""infinite and divine"" all around us, readily available at the touch of our fingertips. As a society, we whould be grateful to Huxley's catatonic introspections and mapping of the human psyche.",truthful
"Ok I bought the book to see what induced Ray Manzarek and Jim Morrison to name their band ""The Doors"". After reading the hyper-intellectualized accounts of getting loaded and then viewing the world while under the influence, the book found a semi permanent lodging place under the edge of my bed. The music of the Doors still moves me and gets played every day I am in my shop. The book is an excellent read before bed because it quickly puts me to sleep. Reading this book 50 years after the fact is not like reading Michner or Camus or Sartre. Its is a stuffy read, dated, and as I discovered.... not like having a crystal ball to peer into the 60's minds of the Doors.",truthful

"I wasn't sure whether to give this 3 or 4 stars (I would have preferred 3.5), so I rounded down. Sorry. As for the book, itself, this is a light, quick and even entertaining take on the market mania that caused the 1929 crash. While the book doesn't go into great detail, it does provide some good insights into both the crowd psychology that always produces crashes as well as the objects of their desire. The investment trusts which were bid up so ridiculously in the late 20's bear just a bit more than an eerie resemblance to the tech stocks of the late 90's, the subprime paper of present day, the MandA mania that recently burst, the housing market, ethanol, sovereign wealth funds and... well just about everything on CNBC these days. More seriously, the similarities between than and now are quite extensive, and one can learn a valuable lesson from the largest calamity in U.S. financial history. I do wish that the book would have gone more into all of the reasons behind not only the crash but also the Great Depression. While the 2 are intertwined, this book only offers insight into the stock market and, sadly, leaves the entire story untold.",truthful
"When I was an undergraduate, the church around which the campus was centered hosted informal luncheons twice a month.  These affairs were held in the church's large and comfortable basement, and usually had nothing to do with religion.  The enticement for students to attend the luncheons (aside from a free box lunch) was the reputation or position of a fellow diner the church had managed to ensnare, and to be included at a gathering, a student had only to sign up while space was still available.  Sometimes this personage would be as humble as the Dean of Student Affairs.  On one occasion, it was John Kenneth Galbraith.  Galbraith, I remember, was arrogant, intelligent, and witty, and all three of these attributes permeate his contribution to the literature on the crash.  Galbraith himself remarks in the introduction that he ""never enjoyed writing a book more,"" and I can well imagine that he laughed out loud as he penned the hilarious passages that make this book so enjoyable.  His explanation of the increase in embezzlement during the late twenties, which he euphemistically calls ""informal financial arrangements,"" and the fall of various illustrious personages associated with the Wall Street crash make for some of the funniest reading I have ever encountered.  There is a serious side to the book, however, wherein Galbraith succinctly analyzes the causes of the crash (in his humble opinion).  For those looking for parallels in today's market, there is one striking similarity between 1929 and today: the impact that the collapse in securities prices had on the well-to-do.  Because the well-to-do, then as now, ""disposed of a large proportion of consumer income,"" and ""were a source of a lion's share of personal saving and investment,"" the losses suffered by this group of investor's ""had broad effects on expenditure and income in the economy at large.""  This, perhaps, is Galbraith's indictment of the capitalist system, and the fact that he offers no remedy for this situation is tacit acceptance of the inherent flaw of capitalism.  Galbraith, though, is no socialist or economic radical.  As he casually claimed during the luncheon I attended, he ran the US economy during World War II, and I've never heard of any extreme economic policies that were instituted during the war.  On the other hand, I'm not now, nor have I ever been, an economist.  Galbraith does a brilliant job of tracing the fluctuations in the market from 1927 to 1932, demonstrating in the process that the crash was not confined to a single day, nor even to a single month.  He explodes a few myths about the crash (it was caused by a lack of available securities; suicides after the crash skyrocketed) and explains the impact of the growth of investment trusts and the lack of involvement by regulatory bodies (such as they were).  It is unlikely a better short course on the crash of 1929 exists, and it is a certainty that no more entertaining book on the subject exists.  Galbraith's little tome is convincing evidence that the dismal science need not be.",truthful
"A Classic! Gives the best explanation of the the causes of the Great Depression and so of the Crash of 2008. Bubbles and crashes have the same causes, only the names change not the fundamentals.  Very interesting the role of Goldman Sachs in both cases",truthful
"Galbraith's 'The Great Crash of 1929' offers a good analysis of why the stock market crashed.  The underlying point throughout the book is that an increasingly fragile financial sector created a speculative bubble which eventually popped. To be clear: Galbraith does not try to prove what caused the Great Depression.  The first 3/5th of the books is on the follow up to the Great Crash, the next 1/5 on its aftermath, and the last 1/5 on how it contributed to the Great Depression.  As an account of the Great Crash it uses easy to understand explanations, clearly written for laymen, centered around a compelling story.  This means that more a sophisticated quantitative analysis, that would have presumably centered around Keyne's 'General Theory', is ignored.  This is conventional in Galbraith's works where he tries to convey economic theory in a language that ordinary people can understand. The problems with Galbraith's analysis is; yes, he does ignore the Federal Reserve and largely omits changes in the money supply.  While Friedman goes as far as to say monetary factors CAUSED the Great Depression most contemporary economist would disagree.  The money hypothesis contributed to the depression but did NOT cause it.  In hindsight Galbraith's tentative analysis of what caused the Great Depression is obviously incomplete but, ironically, more accurate than Friedman's monetary analysis. Someone wishing to understand the Great Depression should look elsewhere.  People looking to understand the theoretical underpinnings of the business cycle and depressions should look elsewhere (ex: Keyne's 'General Theory' or the works of Hyman Minsky).  If you are looking for a good explanation of the Great Crash Galbraith's work stands the test of time.",truthful

"This book does a poor job of explaining what caused the depression.  It gives a sarcastic narrative of some of the bad practices leading up until 1929, and the sarcasm is amusing.  After the sarcasm, in about february of 1930, it stops and draws unjustified and unsupported conclusions.  The narrative comes mainly from reading the New York newspapers.  A description of what happened in rural areas and at small banks is not included.  You will not understand what a run on a bank is, and how small banks were leveraged and destroyed by the depression.  You will hear nothing about the propensity of the federal reserve to keep interest rates too high from 1929 - 1933, and will not know how much they should have been lowered, or if lowering them would have been ineffective.  You will not learn how to draw your own economic conclusions by reading this book.  Because the book is 100% text, a large opportunity is missed to explain some of the economic history through pictures. I think the book is popular because it was written by a Harvard Professor.  I have read several books on the depression and this one, because of the hype, was the greatest disappointment.",truthful
"Gailbraith's book is an insightful and witty history of the Great Crash of 1929.  Though written years ago it seems as if it could have been written yestereday and there are many parallels of course with the economic ""meltdown"" that is going on around us. I can't really fault the book as it is about the Great Crash, but I wish there were more about the long depression that followed and the path to recovery.",truthful

"Calla is an imprint of Dover, the same publisher that used to boast that its paperback books were built to last. Alas, Dover hasn't manufactured paperbacks that way in years, but this clothbound edition looks every bit as durable as it is beautiful. Many will find it an attractive alternative to the Borzoi Book (Everyman's Library) published by Knopf; the paper is finer, and the illustrations (by the Detmold brothers) are reproduced in full color. This book is not, however, a facsimile reprint of the Macmillan edition of 1908. As the publisher's note explains, the plates have been ""reproduced from an extremely scarce, original portfolio of watercolors, and have never before appeared on this scale in book form."" From these remarks one gathers that the illustrations are larger here than in the 1908 edition, some of them spread across two pages. Unfortunately, the binding (unlike that of the Knopf edition) is too firm for the open book to lie flat, so several of these two-page presentations (notably that of Kaa on pages 64-65) are spoiled by the heavy fold down the center. Moreover, in spite of the ""elegant new type design and many additional decorative elements,"" it is annoying to find Kipling's verses centered line by line instead of systematically indented according to their rhyme schemes. One final note: the text appears to be that of the first American edition, not the more established English edition.",truthful

Children and animals are permanent companions and The Jungle Book is as fresh in the 21st century as it was in the 19th.  From a human child reared in the jungle by animals to a domesticated animal who saves his people, the book brings both joy and understanding.  Kipling's masterful descriptions illustrate the jungle, the animals, the people, the town and their interactions far better than popular cartoon versions.  The Jungle Book is rightfully a classic and rightfully from the respected Ozford Press.",truthful

Too many peoeple today simply dismiss him as both racist and imperialist (in other words, judging a 19th century man by 20/21st century standards) but he was of that last generation of poets who tried to learn about their subjects instead of being like the shallow poets of today. This short collection of time honored favorites like the Jungle Book, Rikki Tikki Tavi (the girls loved the great snake fight!), and the White Seal all still glow with life.  Real life is illustrated here, not white washed Hollywood stories where nothing really dies but the interaction between predator and prey is ever present. Kipling in today's world is not something allowed in schools, more the pity.  His writings make most of what kids today have to read insipid.  I only hope other parents/grandparents will allow their offspring the chance to see life how it was and often is today...",truthful
"This review focuses on the audio production of the first Jungle Book as read by Flo Gibson.  I've read many of these stories to my daughter, so I know the difficulty of catching Kipling's rhythm and phrasing.  Flo Gibson does an excellent job, with clear diction, well paced delivery and competent ""acting"" of the various characters.  She pronounces the character's names as attributed to Kipling in the notes of my faithful Penguin edition.  Even then, my 10 year old daughter had difficulty with some of the phrasing, and we paused the CD's as we drove across the country to discuss and clarify.  However, I attribute this difficulty to the richness of Kipling's text, which my daughter is not used to - yet. In short, Flo Gibson uses her talents to deliver Kipling's wonderful stories.  I recommend this unabridged audio edition.",truthful
This was so much fun to read.  I really like the Explanatory Notes which are based on the scientific facts as they were known at the time the book was written because they add to the authenticity of the book just when the reader begins to have some doubts about this fantastical novel.  The Notes provide the background and then take the book into the realm of reality.  I have read enough Darwin and Wallace et al to know that they were indeed thrilled with their discoveries even as they questioned them.  This book is a fun way to illustrate historical perspectives and to awaken the explorer in all of us.  Arthur Conan Doyle is a true literary treasure!,truthful
"I was a little wary in buying classics from Dover Thrift; these are the books I'd want to keep for many years, not just read and discard. But my caution was undeserved! These editions are not flimsy or printed on bible paper; they're sturdy with a pleasing layout and size (I prefer the slightly larger books to the 4.2x6.8 inch standard paperback). This size allows for comfortable reading without damaging the spine like the smaller versions. Highlighting doesn't seep through the paper, an important trait for English majors like myself, and the book is lightweight and the binding tight. So for $3 I was able to buy a book that's normally $7 - with no drawbacks! Thank you Dover Thrift! Also, check out their collections (Jane Austen Collection, Supernatural and Ghost Stories Collection) - Several books for only $8? Awesome!

The characters,plotting, and dialogue of the book are so well written that you can envision everything in it and i literaly could not put this book down.

"Hammett is credited with creating the hard boiled private eye.  People are most familiar with this work and his character Sam Spade. Perhaps because of the part played by Humphrey Bogart, even though it was the third movie made based on this writing. Hammett himself never considered this as his best. He always maintained The Glass Key was his best work. I highly reccomend any and all of his writing.",truthful
"There have been very few examples of movies made from books in which the plot, characters, and mood was far better presented in the movie than in the book. Unfortunately, ""The Maltese Falcon"" ranks in that distinction - at least for me. Perhaps my big mistake was to choose a Hammett novel that was made into a movie - and a movie that has become the definitive film noir. However, the depth of the characters presented in the novel just wasn't there. Even Sam Spade seemed a rather hollow shell, except for the insistance of being morally ambiguous and describing exactly how he rolls a cigarette. Oh, and he's blond. The other characters pass through a mere images, and most of them rather bizarre. I felt that I knew the characters more from the movie than from the book, which was a very strange feeling. Now, the novel is well written, if a bit dated. I think in it's day it was probably downright shocking! It does have a campy feel to it, but in a sort of pleasant, almost guilty way. It is well paced and keeps the reader's interest. And if one does not know the general outcome, I guarantee it will keep one guessing! The book is worth reading for the mystery alone! However, if one has seen the 1940s version of the movie classic with Bogie and Peter Lorre and Mary Aster and Sydney Greenstreet? This might come as a bit of a letdown. Hammett is a good author and I do look forward to reading other of his works that Hollywood did not take notice of to see if I can feel differently. But, for this one, I really do think the movie is far better. Which makes me wonder: is the movie a classic because of the book? Or has the book become a classic because of the movie?",truthful

This is a wonderful disc to accompany a hike in the country, a walk in the woods, or anywhere one is alone in nature.  With his embracing of the simple, unencumbered style of life, and rejection of all material non-essentials, it is easy to see how Thoreau became godfather to the hippie and counter-culture movements of the 1960's.   The reader's near monotone delivery does not exactly make Thoreau's inspired musings spring vividly to life, but his controlled placidity is not unsuited to the serene nature of the narrative either.  It was extremely handy to have all of the unabridged, over eleven hours on one disc; I found myself frequently rewinding to allow a second or third shot at unravelling the complex, but elegant and profound prose passages.   Listening to this audio CD was an excellent way to finally get to know this venerable work; an inspiring classic that most readers are aware of but fewer have actually read.",truthful
