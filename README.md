In the digital age, the proliferation of fake news presents significant challenges to information integrity and public trust. This thesis investigates the development and application of a pre-trained model, a branch of artificial intelligence, for detecting misleading content in articles. Leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning, the research focuses on utilizing a state-of-the-art pre-trained model for detecting and classifying fake news. The model architecture incorporates sophisticated linguistic and contextual analysis to discern subtle deception cues that are often missed by traditional detection methods. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in achieving high accuracy and robustness on various datasets. Finally, this study focuses on 5 different training sets implementing 7 different models which, with the application of appropriate techniques and parameterization of the parameters, give us the best results in the detection of fake news.
